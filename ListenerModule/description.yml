  Handles incoming and outgoing requests appropriately, but does not
  do anything fancy (like talk to a specific peer).
  
  In essence, just sends requests to the host and recieves events from 
  the host. Not all packets are meant to be implemented, as this is a
  temporary measure to ensure synchronization
