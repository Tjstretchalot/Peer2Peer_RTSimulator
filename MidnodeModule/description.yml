description: |
  An 'in-between' node, which will have peers above it as
  well as below it. Short of direct connection, this node
  will relay information to the broadcast module (if it 
  comes from below them), and relay information down(if
  it comes from above them). This peer may have, at most, one
  peer directly above it.
